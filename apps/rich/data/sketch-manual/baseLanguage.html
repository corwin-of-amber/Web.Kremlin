<h1 class="section">Core Language</h1>
<p>
The core sketch language is a simple imperative language that borrows most of its syntax from Java and C.
</p>

<h2 class="subsection">Primitive Types</h2><a class="label" kind="sec" name="primitives"></a>
<p>
The sketch language contains five primitive types, <code class="code kw">bit</code>, <code class="code kw">int</code>, <code class="code kw">char</code>, <code class="code kw">double</code> and <code class="code kw">float</code>. There is a subtyping relation between three of them:
<code class="code kw">bit<span class="math rm spaced symbol" nspaces=6 latex="\sqsubseteq">⊑</span>char<span class="math rm spaced symbol" nspaces=6 latex="\sqsubseteq">⊑</span>int</code>, so bit variables can be used wherever a character or integer is required. 
<code class="code">float</code> and <code class="code">double</code> are completely interchangeable, but there is no subtyping relationship between them and the other types, so for example, you cannot use <span class="math rm">1</span> in place of <span class="math rm">1.0</span>, or <span class="math rm">0</span> in place of <span class="math rm">0.0</span>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
  There are two <code class="code kw">bit</code> constants, <code class="code">0</code>, and <code class="code">1</code>. Bits are also used to represent Booleans; the constants <code class="code kw">false</code> and <code class="code kw">true</code> are syntactic sugar for <code class="code">0</code> and <code class="code">1</code> respectively. In the case of characters, you can use the standard C syntax to represent character constants. 
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  <a class="parameter title">Modeling floating point</a>
  Floating point values (either <code class="code kw">float</code> or <code class="code kw">double</code>) are not handled natively by the synthesizer, so they have to be modeled using other mechanisms. The sketch synthesizer currently supports three different encodings for floating point values, which can be controlled by the flag <code class="code">--fe-fpencoding</code>.
</p>

<dl class="flagdoc">
  <dt class="parameter">fe-fpencoding</dt>
  <dd>
    This flag controls which of three possible encodings are used for floating point values. <code class="code">AS_BIT</code> encodes floating point values using a single bit; addition and subtraction are replaced with <code class="code">xor</code>, and multiplication is replaced with <code class="code">and</code>. Division and comparisons are not supported in this representation, nor are casts to and from integers. <code class="code">AS_FFIELD</code> will encode floating points using a finite field of integers mod 7. This representation does support division, but not comparisons or casts. Finally, <code class="code">AS_FIXPOINT</code> represents floats as fixed point values; this representation supports all the operations, but it is the most expensive.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 class="subsection">Structs</h2>
<p>
More interesting types can be constructed from simpler types in two ways: by creating arrays of them (see <a class="ref" kind="sec" href="#array">link</a>) and by defining new types of heap allocated records.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To define a new record type, the programmer uses the following syntax (borrowed from C):
</p>
<div class="code"
>struct <span class="math">name</span> {
  <span class="math">type<sub class="symbol" latex="_1">1</sub></span> <span class="math">field<sub class="symbol" latex="_1">1</sub></span>;
  ...
  <span class="math">type<sub class="symbol" latex="_k">k</sub></span> <span class="math">field<sub class="symbol" latex="_k">k</sub></span>;
}
</div>

<p class="indent">
To allocate a new record in the heap, the programmer uses the keyword <code class="code kw">new</code>; the syntax is the same as that for constructing an object in Java using the default constructor, but the programmer can also use named parameters to directly initialize certain fields upon allocation as shown in the following example.
</p>

<div class="example">
<p counter-value="1">Use of named parameters to initialize the fields of a struct.</p>
<div class="code"
>struct Point{
  int x;
  int y;
}
void main(){
  Point p1 = new Point();
  assert p1.x == 0 && p1.y == 0; //Fields initialized to default values.

  Point p2 = new Point(x=5, y=7);
  assert p2.x == 5 && p2.y == 7; //Fields initialized by constructor.
}
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">
Records are manipulated through references, which behave the same way as references in Java. The following example illustrates the main properties of records and references in <span class="Sketch"></span>.
</p>

<div class="example">
<p counter-value="2">The example below will behave the same way as an equivalent example would behave in Java. In particular, all the asserts will be satisfied.</p>
<div class="code"
>struct Car {
  int license;
}

void main() {
  Car c = new Car(); // Object C1
  Car d = c;         // after assignment d points to C1
  c.license = 123;   // the field of C1 is updated.
  assert d.license == 123;
  strange(c, d);
  assert d.license == 123; //Object C1 unaffected by call
  assert d == c;
}

void strange(Car x, Car y) {
  x = new Car();  //x now points to a new object C2
  y = new Car();  //y now points to a new object C3
  x.license = 456;
  y.license = 456;
  assert x.license == y.license;
  assert x != y; //x and y point to different objects
}
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">
Just like in Java, references are typesafe and the heap is assumed to be garbage collected (which is another way of saying the synthesizer doesn't model deallocation). A consequence of this is that a reference to a record of type T must either be <code class="code kw">null</code> or point to a valid object of type T. All dereferences have an implicit null pointer check, so dereferencing <code class="code kw">null</code> will cause an assertion failure.
</p>

<h2 class="subsection">Temporary Structures</h2>

<p>
There are instances where it is desirable to have the convenience of structures but without the cost of allocation and dereferencing, and without the burden of reasoning about aliasing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The language supports <em class="emph">temporary structures</em>, which are unboxed, so they do not incur many of the usual costs associated with heap allocated structures. Temporary structures have copy semantics, so the programmer can think of them as primitive values and does not have to worry about aliasing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
One can use temporary structures as local variables and parameters by enclosing the type of the structure in vertical bars <code class="code">|type|</code>. Temporary structures can be created with a constructor <code class="code">|type|(<span class="math">args</span>)</code>, where <span class="math">args</span> are named parameters just like with a normal constructor, but the keyword <code class="code kw">new</code> is not used since nothing is being allocated in the heap. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
Temporary structures have the following properties:
</p>
<ul class="itemize">
  <li class="item">Assignment: assignment of a temporary structure to another results in a copy.</li>
  <li class="item">Equality comparison: an equality comparison of two temporary structures is equivalent to the conjunction of their field-by-field comparison.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent">
The following example illustrates the use of unboxed functions.
</p>

<div class="example"><p counter-value="3"></p>
<div class="code"
>struct Point {
   int x;
   int y;
}

...
|Point| p1 = |Point|(x=5, y=3); // temporary point initialized to (5,3).
Point p2 = new Point(x=3, y=2); // heap allocated point initialized to (3,2).
|Point| p3 = p1; // temporary point p3 is a copy of p1.
p3.x = 10;
Point p4 = p2; // p4 and p2 point to the same heap allocated object.
p4.x= 15;
assert p1.x == 5;
assert p2.x == 15;
assert p3.x = 10;
assert p4.x == 15;
if(??) assert p1 == p2; // equivalent to p1.x == p2.x && p1.y==p2.y
if(??) assert p1 != p2; // equivalent to !(p1==p2)
</div>
</div>

<p class="paragraph">
  <a class="parameter title">Interaction of temporary and heap allocated structures</a>
An assignment from a heap allocated structure to a temporary structure is interpreted as a field-by-field copy. 
In the above example, an assignment <code class="code">p3 = p2;</code> would be equivalent to
</p>
<div class="code"
>p3.x = px.x; p3.y = p2.y;
</div>

<p class="indent">
Such an assignment requires that <code class="code">p2</code> not be <code class="code kw">null</code>. Similarly, an assignment from a temporary structure to a heap allocated structure is also interpreted as a field-by-field copy, with a similar assertion that the reference will not be null. Failure to satisfy the assumption will cause an assertion failure. 
</p>

<p class="indent">
Similarly, an equality comparison of a heap allocated structure and a temporary structure will be equivalent to a field-by-field comparison.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
  <a class="parameter title">Restrictions</a>
In the current version of the language, temporary structures are only allowed for local variables and function parameters. In particular, the language currently does not allow arrays of temporary structures or temporary structure fields in other structures. These restrictions are likely to be lifted in future versions of the language. Finally, structures with lists inside them are not allowed to be temporary structures.
